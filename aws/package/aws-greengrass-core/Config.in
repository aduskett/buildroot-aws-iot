	  AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS to edge devices so
	  they can act locally on the data they generate, while
	  still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable
	  storage. With AWS IoT Greengrass, connected devices can run
	  AWS Lambda functions, Docker containers, or both,
	  execute predictions based on machine learning models, keep
	  device data in sync, and communicate with other devices
	  securely â€“ even when not connected to the Internet.
