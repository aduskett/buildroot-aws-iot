Subject: [PATCH] Allow in-source builds

Buildroot doesn't have a mechanism to build outside of a source tree, and even
if Buildroot did, it isn't necessary to build properly.

The reason for disallowing in-source builds is:
"Out-of-source builds are highly recommended because CMake does not track
 any files generated or created as part of running CMake."

Which isn't a concern of Buildroot.
