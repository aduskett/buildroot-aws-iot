	  The Device SDK simplifies access to the Pub/Sub functionality
	  of the AWS IoT broker via MQTT and provides APIs to interact
	  with Thing Shadows. The SDK has been tested to work with the
	  AWS IoT platform to ensure best interoperability of a device
	  with the AWS IoT platform.

	  NOTE: A new AWS IoT Device SDK is now available. It is a
	        complete rework, built to improve reliability,
	        performance, and security. This SDK will no longer
	        receive feature updates, but will receive security
	        updates.
