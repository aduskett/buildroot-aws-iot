	  The SSM Agent runs on EC2 instances and enables you to quickly
	  and easily execute remote commands or scripts against one or
	  more instances. The agent uses SSM documents. When you execute
	  a command, the agent on the instance processes the document
	  and configures the instance as specified. Currently, the agent
	  and Run Command enable you to quickly run Shell scripts on an
	  instance using the AWS-RunShellScript SSM document. SSM Agent
	  also enables the Session Manager capability that lets you
	  manage your Amazon EC2 instance through an interactive
	  one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI. When the
	  agent starts, it will create a user called "ssm-user" with
	  sudo or administrator privilege. Session Manager sessions will
	  be launched in context of this user.
