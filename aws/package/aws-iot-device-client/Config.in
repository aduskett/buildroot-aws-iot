	  The AWS IoT Device Client is free, open-source, modular
	  software written in C++ that you can compile and install on
	  your Embedded Linux based IoT devices to access AWS IoT Core,
	  AWS IoT Device Management, and AWS IoT Device Defender
	  features by default. It serves as a reference implementation
	  for your IoT devices to work with AWS IoT services, with
	  operational best practices baked in – using it is the easiest
	  way to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) for your IoT project.
	  What’s more, since it is open-source, you can modify it to fit
	  your business needs, or optimize it when you wish to scale up
	  from a PoC to production.
