Subject: [PATCH] revert commit b13d3f3f724bf0ce44200760c81fbbccc07f6302

Commit b13d3f3f724bf0ce44200760c81fbbccc07f6302 forces all dependent libraries
to link statically, which is undersirable when building in a cross-compiled
environment that may not be compiling static libraries. Especially since many
of those libraries either compile shared libraries OR static libraries, but not
both at the same time.
