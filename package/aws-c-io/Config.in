	  This is a module for the AWS SDK for C. It handles all IO and
	  TLS work for application protocols.

	  aws-c-io is an event driven framework for implementing
	  application protocols. It is built on top of cross-platform
	  abstractions that allow you as a developer to think only about
	  the state machine and API for your protocols. A typical
	  use-case would be to write something like Http on top of
	  asynchronous-io with TLS already baked in. All of the platform
	  and security concerns are already handled for you.

	  It is designed to be light-weight, fast, portable, and
	  flexible for multiple domain use-cases such as: embedded,
	  server, client, and mobile.
